# Workload Modeling

- SIGMOD'18 - P-Store: An Elastic Database System with Predictive Provisioning
- IEEE CloudCom'18 - DERP: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Cloud System for Elastic Resource Provisioning
  - https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8590989
  - Motivation: previous work can not deal with large input space so we need a learning based method.
  - Method: Uses a DQN RL agent to decide when to add/remove machines and how many machines are added/removed to a DBMS cluster.
  - Key Points:
    - Targeting on NoSQL systems.
- VLDB'19 - iBTune: individualized buffer tuning for large-scale cloud databases
  - https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.14778/3339490.3339503
  - Focus on tuning buffer size
