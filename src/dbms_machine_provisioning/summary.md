# DBMS Machine Provisioning

- [ICAC'11 - A Bayesian Approach to Online Performance Modeling for Database Appliances using Gaussian Models](sheikh2011bayesian.md)
  - Problem: modeling DBMS workloads using Gaussian Process
  - Keys:
    - It only focuses on modeling workloads and does not propose any application.
    - It demonstrate GP can predict quite accurate with small data set.
- [SIGMOD'18 - P-Store: An Elastic Database System with Predictive Provisioning](taft2018pstore.md)
  - Motivation: previous work always react after an overloaded event happens.
  - Problem: they propose to make machine provisioning decision by predicting the following workloads.
  - Keys:
    - The target workload must be easy to predict.
    - There can be a few distributed transactions.
- IEEE CloudCom'18 - DERP: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Cloud System for Elastic Resource Provisioning
  - <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8590989>
  - Motivation: previous work can not deal with large input space so we need a learning based method.
  - Method: Uses a DQN RL agent to decide when to add/remove machines and how many machines are added/removed to a DBMS cluster.
  - Key Points:
    - Targeting on NoSQL systems.
- VLDB'19 - iBTune: individualized buffer tuning for large-scale cloud databases
  - <https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.14778/3339490.3339503>
  - Focus on tuning buffer size
